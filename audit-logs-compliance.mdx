## Overview

Audit logs in Videograph provide structured records of important actions performed across an organization. They help administrators, security teams, and compliance stakeholders maintain accountability, review changes, and investigate unexpected behavior.

These logs record meaningful events such as user sign-ins, asset modifications, configuration updates, and permission changes. They offer visibility into who performed an action, what changed, and when it occurred.

## What gets logged

Videograph captures high-level categories of activity to support operational transparency:

- Authentication and access events, including sign-ins.
- Content lifecycle actions such as uploads, updates, or deletions of assets and related resources.
- Workspace and organization configuration changes.
- Role, permission, and team membership updates.
- API key and credential management actions.
- Other administrative operations that influence system behavior or security posture.

## Typical uses

Audit logs are commonly used by operational and compliance teams for:

### Change tracking
- Reviewing who modified a video asset, workflow setting, or credential.
- Monitoring workspace or organizational configuration adjustments.

### Incident investigation
- Tracing the sequence of actions preceding an operational issue.
- Analyzing access patterns for potential misuse or unexpected activity.

### Compliance and periodic reviews
- Supporting internal governance checks.
- Providing evidence for risk assessments or routine audits.
- Validating that changes follow established approval processes.

## Access and retention considerations

Access to audit logs is typically restricted to users with appropriate administrative or security roles. Organizations may apply their own controls and approval workflows before granting visibility to sensitive records.

Retention of audit logs varies by internal policy. Videograph provides logging capabilities you can incorporate into your governance strategy, but you should define retention periods, export flows, and archival methods according to your organizational requirements.

## Best practices for teams using audit logs

- Establish clear internal policies for who can access audit logs and under what conditions.
- Incorporate audit log reviews into incident response and post-incident processes.
- Regularly export or archive logs according to your organization’s record-keeping policies.
- Cross-reference audit log entries with workflow approvals or ticketing systems when researching changes.
- Periodically validate that logging covers the actions your team considers critical for oversight.
