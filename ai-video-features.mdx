## Overview

Videograph may provide AI-assisted capabilities that help teams accelerate routine editorial tasks. These tools are designed to support workflows across ingest, editing, and publishing, while keeping human judgment at the center of decision-making.

<Callout kind="info">

AI-assisted features are intended to guide users, not replace editorial review. Always validate outputs before publishing.

## Types of AI-assisted features

### Thumbnail suggestions

AI-based thumbnail suggestions can surface visually representative frames or propose multiple candidate images that match typical viewer engagement patterns. These suggestions may help teams select strong promotional images more quickly than manual scrubbing alone.

### Content-aware scene detection

Scene or segment detection can help identify natural boundaries in longer videos such as chapter breaks, camera changes, or topic shifts. These signals may support downstream workflows like clipping, metadata assignment, or editorial review.

### Automated highlight identification

For long-form events such as conferences, sports, or multi-hour streams, automated highlight detection can surface moments that may merit clipping or promotion. Outputs are intended as candidates for editors to review rather than fully automated edits.

### Metadata and tag suggestions

Metadata suggestions can assist with descriptive fields such as topics, keywords, or recurring on-screen subjects. These recommendations help maintain consistent taxonomy across large libraries, complementing manual metadata workflows described in the page at `/vod-metadata-tags`.

## How they fit into workflows

### Ingest

When new video is ingested, AI-assisted features may run alongside standard processing. Early outputs such as scene markers or draft thumbnails can appear in asset detail views to expedite review.

### Editing and review

Editors can use suggestions as entry points, refining thumbnail selections, approving or discarding highlights, and adjusting scene boundaries. These suggestions supplement tools described across ingest and editing pages including `/vod-thumbnails-subtitles-overlays`.

### Publishing

Suggested metadata or recommended highlights can streamline the last mile of preparing assets for distribution. Teams can selectively adopt or revise any AI-generated fields before publishing.

### Analytics

Some AI-assisted features may interact with analytics by helping categorize content, which can improve reporting consistency across pages like `/analytics-overview`.

## Responsible use

### Human review

Every automated suggestion should be reviewed by a human editor. AI models may misinterpret context, especially for content with subtle cues or domain-specific meaning.

### QA and guardrails

Teams should define internal QA steps such as periodic audits or sampling reviews to ensure outputs align with brand and content standards. Guardrails like approval workflows, restricted editing permissions, or automated checks can help ensure AI assistance does not bypass established controls.

### Evolving capabilities

These AI-assisted features may change over time as models evolve, workflows expand, or new video formats emerge. Treat outputs as starting points that complement the broader Videograph toolset rather than as fixed or authoritative results.
