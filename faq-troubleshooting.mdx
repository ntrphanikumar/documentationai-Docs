## General guidance

<Callout kind="info">

Before troubleshooting, check your platform status page or incident communications. Widespread issues may already be identified or mitigated.

</Callout>

## Getting started

### Q: I cannot access my workspace or see the right resources  
**A:** Ensure your account has been added to the correct workspace and role. See [Accounts, Workspaces & Roles](/accounts-workspaces-roles).

Quick checks:
- Confirm you are logged in with the expected identity provider.  
- Ask an administrator to verify your role assignment.  
- If recently added, refresh your session or sign out and back in.

### Q: My API requests are failing with unauthorized or forbidden errors  
**A:** Verify your API key or token is valid and has the correct scope. See [Authentication & Authorization](/authentication).

Quick checks:
- Check for expired test tokens.  
- Ensure you are using the correct environment key.  
- Make sure your client clock is not significantly skewed.

## Playback issues

### Q: Playback will not start or shows an unsupported format error  
**A:** Confirm the asset is fully processed and has the needed renditions. See [Uploading & Ingesting Video](/vod-uploading-ingesting) and [Encoding Profiles & Renditions](/vod-encoding-profiles).

Quick checks:
- Check the asset processing status in your dashboard.  
- Verify the player is loading over HTTPS.  
- Confirm your browser supports the requested format.

### Q: Playback buffers frequently or stalls  
**A:** Review network delivery and rendition availability. See [Players, SDKs & Embeds](/players-sdks-embeds).

Quick checks:
- Test on a different network or device.  
- Confirm the lowest-resolution rendition is present.  
- Inspect network waterfall for long or missing segment downloads.

### Q: Secure playback is failing or tokens are rejected  
**A:** Confirm your token signing logic matches platform expectations. See [Secure Playback](/vod-secure-playback).

Quick checks:
- Ensure your token includes all required fields.  
- Verify the signing key matches what is configured in your workspace.  
- Check for time-based mismatches such as expired tokens.

## Live streaming

### Q: My encoder says there is no ingest or it cannot connect  
**A:** Validate your RTMP or SRT settings and stream state. See [Live Stream Basics](/live-stream-basics).

Quick checks:
- Confirm the stream is set to active or ready.  
- Copy the ingest URL and stream key again to avoid hidden characters.  
- Test with a known-good encoder profile.

### Q: Live latency is higher than expected  
**A:** Review your player configuration and segment durations. See [Live Monitoring & Health Checks](/live-monitoring-health).

Quick checks:
- Validate the player is not in low-latency-disabled mode.  
- Check if your encoder uses short segment settings.  
- Compare measured latency on multiple networks.

### Q: My live recording or VOD output is missing  
**A:** Ensure recording is enabled and the stream reached a stable state. See [Live Recording & VOD Conversion](/live-recording-vod).

Quick checks:
- Check if the stream ended cleanly.  
- Verify your workspace has recording enabled.  
- Review logs or events for ingest interruptions.

## SSAI and monetization

### Q: No ads are appearing  
**A:** Confirm the SSAI configuration and ad rules are enabled. See [Configuring Dynamic Ad Insertion](/ssai-configuring).

Quick checks:
- Validate your ad decisioning endpoint returns valid responses.  
- Confirm the ad break markers exist.  
- Check the player is using the SSAI URL.

### Q: Ad fill is low or breaks behave oddly  
**A:** Review targeting rules and fallback settings. See [Ad Rules, Targeting & Validation](/ssai-rules-targeting).

Quick checks:
- Inspect returned ad responses for missing creatives.  
- Ensure your targeting rules are not overly restrictive.  
- Validate ad durations match expected break lengths.

## Analytics and reporting

### Q: My view counts do not match other analytics tools  
**A:** Different tools measure sessions and starts differently. See [Analytics Overview](/analytics-overview).

Quick checks:
- Compare the same timezone and date range.  
- Confirm filtering or segmentation is aligned.  
- Note that autoplays and retries may be counted differently.

### Q: Analytics data is delayed  
**A:** Some metrics process in batches. See [Real-Time Monitoring](/analytics-realtime) and [Reporting & Exporting Data](/analytics-reporting-export).

Quick checks:
- Check expected latency for each metric type.  
- Verify your filters are not excluding data.  
- Ensure your time window is wide enough to account for ingestion delays.

## Management and security

### Q: Users cannot access certain tools or features  
**A:** Verify organization or team role configuration. See [Organizations, Teams & Roles](/management-orgs-teams).

Quick checks:
- Check for disabled teams or pending invitations.  
- Ensure role inheritance is set up as expected.  
- Confirm user authentication method matches what your org requires.

### Q: I accidentally exposed an API key  
**A:** Revoke and rotate the affected credentials immediately. See [API Keys, Secrets & Security Best Practices](/management-api-security).

Quick checks:
- Rotate the key in your workspace settings.  
- Redeploy any services using the old key.  
- Review audit logs for misuse indicators.
