## Overview

Videograph surfaces monetization metrics for SSAI-enabled streams and FAST channels so you can understand how ad demand, inventory, and configuration affect both revenue and viewer experience. These analytics help product and monetization teams evaluate performance across ad pods, channels, and content while identifying where optimizations will have the greatest impact.

## Core metrics

Videograph tracks metrics tied to ad delivery quality and demand behavior across SSAI and FAST workloads.

### Impressions

- Total ad impressions across all served ad slots.
- Includes midroll, preroll, and ad pod placements.
- Useful for tracking demand volume and pacing trends.

### Fill rate

- Percentage of requested ad opportunities that resulted in a successfully served creative.
- Indicates the alignment between available inventory and ad demand.
- Lower fill often reflects targeting constraints, supply-demand imbalance, or ad server throttling.

### Error rate

- Frequency of failed ad requests, including categories such as no-ad-returned and timeouts.
- Helps identify integration or demand-side issues that reduce monetizable opportunities.

When reviewing revenue or impression numbers, expect normal differences between Videograph counts and third‑party ad server reports due to measurement methods and timing. Many teams reconcile these data sources regularly to reach an aligned revenue view.

## Revenue and yield

Videograph provides revenue-oriented dimensions that help you evaluate the effectiveness of your SSAI and FAST monetization strategy.

### eCPM

- Effective cost per mille calculated using impression counts and recorded revenue.
- Useful for comparing monetization efficiency across channels, shows, or ad breaks.

### Revenue by dimension

You can segment revenue by:

- Channel or FAST feed
- Show, series, or episode
- Time ranges or scheduling blocks
- Ad pod position (for example, first slot versus later slots)

These views support yield analysis, trend monitoring, and A/B evaluation of configuration changes.

## Channel and content breakdowns

Breakdowns help you understand where revenue is generated and how different catalog segments perform.

### Channel-level insights

- Channel-level impressions, fill, and error patterns to highlight delivery or demand issues.
- Revenue per channel to understand overall contribution and pacing.

### Content-level insights

- Show-level or episode-level revenue and impression volume.
- Comparison of ad performance across genres, seasons, or flagship titles.

## Using analytics to optimize

Use these metrics to guide decisions across programming, ad configuration, and demand management. Common questions teams answer with Videograph analytics include:

- Which channels or shows generate the highest monetizable watch time?
- Are certain ad pods underperforming due to low fill or high error rates?
- How do changes to ad rules or targeting influence eCPM?
- Where do timeout or no-ad-returned errors affect viewer experience and revenue?
- Are certain channels showing yield degradation that suggests inventory saturation?
- Do premium content segments justify differentiated ad strategies?
