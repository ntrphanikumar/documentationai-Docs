title: Launch a FAST Channel with SSAI
description: Step-by-step tutorial for creating a linear FAST channel, enabling server-side ad insertion, and validating playback before launch.
---

## Overview

This tutorial shows you how to build a simple linear or FAST channel backed by on-demand assets and monetized through server-side ad insertion. You will define a programming schedule, configure a channel output, connect an ad server, add ad rules, and validate playback.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with assets, playlists, and channels. See [Assets, Streams, Channels & Playlists](/assets-streams-channels-playlists).
- VOD assets uploaded and processed.
- Access to an ad server or ad decisioning endpoint.
- A test workspace or staging environment recommended.

Start with a low-traffic or staging channel to verify ad behavior, fill rate, and playback stability before moving to production.

## Step 1: Prepare content and programming blocks

Linear channels require a schedule that determines what plays and when. You can structure this using playlists or a block-based schedule.

### Common patterns

- A looped playlist of VOD assets.
- Time-coded segments programmed over a 24-hour grid.
- A short schedule repeated throughout the day.

### What you need to define

- The ordered list of assets.
- Optional bumpers or interstitials.
- Duration and rotation rules.

## Step 2: Create a channel and configure output

Create a channel and set up the delivery profile that players will consume.

### Typical output configuration

- HLS or DASH packaging.
- Multi-bitrate ladders.
- Target latency appropriate to FAST distribution.

Once created, verify that the channel starts correctly and that the schedule loops or follows the timeline as intended.

## Step 3: Enable SSAI and connect an ad server

Attach an SSAI configuration to your channel and provide the ad decisioning endpoint. Follow the setup guide in [Configuring Dynamic Ad Insertion](/ssai-configuring).

### Required inputs

- The ad server URL.
- Any authentication parameters.
- Optional content metadata forwarded as ad-targeting signals.

## Step 4: Define ad breaks and rules

Specify when and how ad breaks should occur. This may include pre-roll, mid-roll, or fixed-position breaks within your programming blocks.

For available rule types, targeting logic, and validation options, see [Ad Rules, Targeting & Validation](/ssai-rules-targeting).

### Break configuration concepts

- Break duration targets.
- Maximum ads per break.
- Frequency capping rules.
- Targeting signals mapped from channel or asset metadata.

## Step 5: Test playback and ad delivery

Before launch, validate that the channel plays correctly and that ad requests and insertions behave as expected.

### What to test

- Start-up behavior and first-break delivery.
- Break transitions and slate handling.
- Fill rate and returned ad decision responses.
- Rendition switching and stability.

## Launch checklist

- Channel loops or follows schedule without gaps.
- SSAI configuration is active and validated against your ad server.
- Break rules are correct for your programming pattern.
- Playback tested on multiple devices and networks.
- Monitoring and analytics dashboards ready for launch.
