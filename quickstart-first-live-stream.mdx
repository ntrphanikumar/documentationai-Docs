title: "Quickstart: First Live Stream"
description: "Create your first live stream, push RTMP from an encoder, and test playback."
---

## Overview

This quickstart walks you through creating a live stream, sending RTMP from an encoder, and obtaining a playback URL. Videograph supports low-latency live streaming over RTMP or SRT and can produce on-demand assets from live recordings.

## Prerequisites

- A Videograph account. See [Introduction to Videograph](/introduction).
- An API key with permission to create live streams. See [Authentication & Authorization](/authentication).
- An RTMP-compatible encoder such as OBS, vMix, or a hardware encoder.

## Create and publish your first live stream

<Steps>

  <Step title="Create a live stream via API" icon="terminal">
    
    Use the API to create a new live stream and obtain the ingest endpoint and stream key.

    <CodeGroup tabs="curl">
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.videograph.example/live/streams" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "My First Live Stream"
  }'
```
    </CodeGroup>

    The response includes fields such as `ingest_url` and `stream_key`, which you will use in your encoder.
  
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your encoder" icon="settings">

    Set your encoder to push RTMP to Videograph using the values returned by the API call.

    <CodeGroup tabs="encoder-config">
```yaml
rtmp:
  url: "rtmp://ingest.videograph.example/live"
  streamKey: "YOUR_STREAM_KEY"
video:
  codec: h264
  bitrate: 4500k
audio:
  codec: aac
  bitrate: 128k
```
    </CodeGroup>

    Save the configuration in your encoder.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Start streaming and verify status" icon="play-circle">

    Start the live output from your encoder.  
    In your Videograph dashboard or via API, confirm the stream is receiving data and is in a `live` state.

    <Callout kind="info">
      
      Verification typically becomes available a few seconds after the first RTMP packets arrive.
      
    </Callout>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Get and test the playback URL" icon="monitor">

    Retrieve the playback URL from the API response or your dashboard.  
    It typically looks like `https://player.videograph.example/live/STREAM_ID.m3u8`.

    Open the URL in your browser or your player integration. See [Players, SDKs & Embeds](/players-sdks-embeds) for embed options.
