title: "Quickstart: First Live Stream"
description: "Create your first live stream, push RTMP from an encoder, and test playback using the Videograph Live Stream API."
---

## Overview

This quickstart walks you through creating a live stream, sending RTMP from an encoder, and obtaining a playback URL. Videograph supports low-latency live streaming and can optionally record the session to produce an on-demand asset. For a full production‑ready workflow, see the deeper guide in [Live Streaming & Recording via API](/live-recording-vod). For conceptual background, you may also review [Live Stream Basics](/live-stream-basics).

## Prerequisites

- A Videograph account. See [Introduction to Videograph](/introduction).
- An API key with permission to create live streams. See [Authentication & Authorization](/authentication).
- An RTMP-compatible encoder such as OBS, vMix, or a hardware encoder.
- Optional: [Live Stream Basics](/live-stream-basics) if you want additional context before running your first test.

## Create and publish your first live stream

<Steps>

  <Step title="Create a live stream via API" icon="terminal">

    Create a live stream and obtain the key values you will use in later steps: `rtmpUrl`, `streamKey`, and `playbackUrl`.  
    The minimal request includes `title`, `region`, and `record`.

    <CodeGroup tabs="curl">
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.videograph.ai/video/services/api/v1/livestreams" \
  -u "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY:YOUR_SECRET_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "My First Live Stream",
    "region": "in",
    "record": true
  }'
```
    </CodeGroup>

    A successful response returns the ingest URL and playback details needed for setup.

    <Callout kind="info">

      
      Setting `record` to `true` enables live recording. With `record` set to `false`, the stream is ephemeral and not saved. Example RTMP endpoints from legacy setups include `rtmp://rc-ingest.in.videograph.ai/rec` (recording) and `rtmp://ingest.in.videograph.ai/live` (non-recording). These are examples only.
      
    </Callout>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your encoder" icon="settings">

    Configure your encoder using the `rtmpUrl` and `streamKey` returned by the API.

    <CodeGroup tabs="encoder-config">
```yaml
rtmp:
  url: "rtmp://INGEST_ENDPOINT_FROM_API"
  streamKey: "STREAM_KEY_FROM_API"
video:
  codec: h264
  bitrate: 4500k
audio:
  codec: aac
  bitrate: 128k
```
    </CodeGroup>

    Save the configuration in your encoder.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Start streaming and verify status" icon="play-circle">

    Begin streaming from your encoder.  
    In your Videograph dashboard or via API, confirm that data is arriving and that the stream transitions to a `live` state.

    <Callout kind="info">

      
      Status updates appear shortly after the first RTMP packets arrive.
      
    </Callout>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Get and test the playback URL" icon="monitor">

    Retrieve the `playbackUrl` from the API or from your dashboard.  
    This HLS URL becomes active once the stream is live.

    Open the playback URL in your browser or your player integration. For embed options, see [Players, SDKs & Embeds](/players-sdks-embeds).
