## Overview

After you create on-demand or live content, Videograph returns playback information that you can embed directly in any web or app player. VOD creation responses include a playback ID or a ready HLS playback URL. Live stream creation responses include fields such as `playbackUrl`, `rtmpUrl`, `streamKey`, and status.

These values point to an HLS playlist (an `.m3u8` file). Supplying that URL as the source of your video element or player SDK starts streaming.

Related background concepts are covered in [Content Model & Playback Basics](/core-video-pipeline) and the ingest workflow in [Uploading Videos (Dashboard & API)](/vod-uploading-ingesting).

## Retrieving playback information

When a VOD asset reaches the ready state, the content API response includes:

- A playback ID that resolves to an HLS playlist URL, or

- A direct HLS playback URL.

For live streams, the creation response includes a `playbackUrl` that becomes active once the stream starts publishing.

Use the HLS `.m3u8` URL as the `src` of your HTML5 video element or provide it to your player initializer.

  For secure playback, use tokenized HLS URLs generated on your server. See [Secure Playback](/vod-secure-playback).

## Basic HTML5 video playback

A simple HTML5 `video` element can play your HLS source directly.

```html
<video
  id="my-player"
  controls
  src="https://example.com/path/to/playlist.m3u8">
</video>
```

Most browsers handle HLS natively or through Media Source Extensions. If you need a JavaScript HLS library, attach it to the same `video` element.

## Using simple embeds or the Web SDK

Videograph supports two primary integration styles. A comparison is available in [Players, SDKs & Embeds](/players-sdks-embeds).

- Simple embeds\
  Good for quick plug-and-play playback.

- Web SDK or custom players\
  Useful when you need programmatic control, custom UI, or event handling.

## Initializing playback with JavaScript

The example below shows a generic initialization pattern using a `createPlayer` function. Supply your VOD or live HLS URL as `playbackUrl`.

```javascript
// Obtain a reference to your HTML container
const container = document.getElementById("player-root");

// Initialize a player instance
const player = createPlayer({
  container: container,
  source: {
    type: "vod", // or "live"
    playbackUrl: "https://example.com/path/to/playlist.m3u8"
  },
  poster: "https://example.com/poster.jpg",
  autoplay: false,
  muted: false
});

// Start playback when ready
player.on("ready", () => {
  player.play();
});
```

You can pass optional fields such as `captions`, `controls`, or `autoplay` depending on your UI needs.

## Handling common events

Subscribe to player events to update UI or record analytics.

```javascript
player.on("play", () => {
  console.log("Playback started");
});

player.on("pause", () => {
  console.log("Playback paused");
});

player.on("timeupdate", (data) => {
  // Inspect data.currentTime as needed
});
```

## Notes on live streams

Live stream creation responses provide a `playbackUrl` that becomes active when the live session begins publishing. Plug this URL into your HTML5 element or player initializer the same way you would for VOD.

For details on live workflows, see [Live Streaming Overview](/live-stream-basics).

  Both VOD and live playback URLs may be tokenized based on your security configuration. Generate short-lived tokens server-side.
