## Overview

This guide explains how to embed Videograph playback in your web application using either a lightweight embed or a more flexible Web SDK. You will learn how to initialize players for on-demand assets and live streams, apply common configuration options, and connect playback events to your analytics pipeline.

## Integration options

Videograph supports two primary integration paths for web apps:

### Simple embed

- Easiest way to add playback.
- Ideal when you only need to display a video or live stream without custom UI or deep event handling.
- Uses a standard iframe-style snippet generated by your dashboard or backend.

### Web SDK

- Provides programmatic control over playback.
- Offers event hooks, state inspection, and integration with your app components.
- Recommended when building custom video experiences or connecting analytics.

For high-level conceptual differences, see the related overview in [Players, SDKs & Embeds](/players-sdks-embeds).

## Initializing a player

The Web SDK supports both VOD and live playback through a simple creation API. The example below demonstrates a pseudo-code setup that you can adapt to your framework.

```javascript
// Load SDK script or import from your bundle

const container = document.getElementById("player-root");

const player = createPlayer({
  container: container,
  source: {
    type: "vod", // or "live"
    playbackUrl: "https://example.com/path/to/playlist.m3u8"
  }
});

// Start playback when ready
player.on("ready", () => {
  player.play();
});
```

Use the appropriate playback URL or tokenized URL provided by your backend. For secure playback considerations, see [Authentication & Authorization](/authentication) and [Secure Playback](/vod-secure-playback).

## Configuring playback options

You can pass optional configuration to match your UI needs. Common fields include:

- `poster`: URL for the preview image.
- `autoplay`: start automatically when allowed by browser rules.
- `muted`: required for autoplay in many environments.
- `captions`: list of caption tracks with language and label metadata.
- `controls`: whether the default UI controls are visible.

Example:

```javascript
const player = createPlayer({
  container: container,
  source: {
    type: "vod",
    playbackUrl: "https://example.com/vod.m3u8"
  },
  poster: "https://example.com/poster.jpg",
  autoplay: true,
  muted: true,
  captions: [
    { src: "/captions/en.vtt", lang: "en", label: "English" }
  ]
});
```

## Events and analytics hooks

The Web SDK provides callbacks for key player moments. You can use them to send structured analytics events or to update your UI.

```javascript
player.on("play", () => {
  sendAnalyticsEvent("video_play");
});

player.on("pause", () => {
  sendAnalyticsEvent("video_pause");
});

player.on("timeupdate", (data) => {
  // data.currentTime can be inspected here
});
```

Use your existing analytics pipeline to process these events. If you need an overview of analytic metrics, see [Analytics Overview](/analytics-overview).

Test your integration across desktop browsers, mobile devices, and network conditions to validate autoplay behavior, caption rendering, and stream stability.

## Secure playback considerations

Videograph typically secures playback using short-lived tokens generated by your backend before embedding or initializing the player. When using the Web SDK:

- Generate playback tokens server-side only.
- Inject each token into the `playbackUrl` or source object as part of the SDK initialization.
- Avoid exposing secret keys or signing logic in client code.
