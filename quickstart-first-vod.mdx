description: "Upload your first MP4 to Videograph and play it back through a simple embed."
---

## Overview

This quickstart shows you how to upload a single MP4 file, wait for processing, and then play it back using a basic embed. The flow reflects Videograph ingest and playback behavior: authenticate with an API key, POST a video for ingestion, poll for processing completion, then use the returned playback URL in your client.

## Prerequisites

- A Videograph account  
- An API key (see the authentication guide at [/authentication](/authentication))  
- A local MP4 file to upload

## Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload a video via API" icon="upload-cloud">

    Use a POST request to send your MP4 file to Videograph. The request returns an asset identifier you can use to check processing status.

    <CodeGroup tabs="cURL,JavaScript">
      ```bash
curl -X POST https://api.videograph.example.com/v1/assets \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/video.mp4"
      ```
      ```javascript
const form = new FormData();
form.append("file", fileInput.files[0]);

const res = await fetch("https://api.videograph.example.com/v1/assets", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
  },
  body: form
});

const data = await res.json();
console.log("Asset ID:", data.id);
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Check encoding status" icon="activity">

    Poll the asset until its status indicates processing is complete. Use the asset ID you received from the upload call.

    ```bash
curl -X GET https://api.videograph.example.com/v1/assets/ASSET_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Get a playback URL or embed" icon="play-circle">

    When the asset status is ready, the response includes a playback URL you can use in any web player or in your application. For more on players, see [/players-sdks-embeds](/players-sdks-embeds).

    ```bash
# Example snippet from a completed asset response
{
  "id": "ASSET_ID",
  "status": "ready",
  "playback": {
    "url": "https://player.videograph.example.com/embed/ASSET_ID"
  }
}
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test in your browser" icon="monitor">

    Open the playback URL in your browser. You should see a working embed for your video.

    ```html
<iframe
  src="https://player.videograph.example.com/embed/ASSET_ID"
  width="640"
  height="360"
  allow="autoplay"
></iframe>
    ```
