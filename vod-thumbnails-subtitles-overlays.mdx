- Automatically generated or custom thumbnails for discovery and player UI.
- Subtitles and captions provided through standard sidecar files.
- Graphic overlays for branding or informational elements.

These features are typically applied during ingest or asset configuration. For an overview of how assets move through the system, see [Video Pipeline: Ingest, Process, Deliver](/core-video-pipeline).

## Thumbnails

Videograph creates thumbnails automatically at ingest, or you can upload your own.

### Automatic thumbnails

- A poster image is generated during ingest.
- Useful when you do not have a custom design ready.
- Ensures every asset has a baseline visual preview.

### Custom thumbnails

- You can upload a custom poster image during or after ingest.
- Recommended when you need brand consistency or editorial control.

### Recommended specifications

- Use a high‑resolution image with a 16:9 aspect ratio.
- Keep the file size optimized for fast loading while maintaining clarity.
- Prefer formats like PNG or JPEG.

## Subtitles

Videograph works with sidecar subtitle files that are attached as caption tracks.

### Supported formats

- WebVTT is the standard supported format for captions.
- Provide one file per language track.

### Ingestion options

- Upload subtitle files alongside the primary video during ingest.
- Add or update tracks after ingest from your management workflow.

### Language tracks

Each caption track should include:

- A language code (for example, `en`, `es`, `fr`).
- A clear label for use in players or UI.

## Overlays

Graphic overlays let you place visual elements on top of video for branding or context.

### What overlays can include

- Channel bugs or watermarks.
- Lower thirds or titles.
- Time‑based graphics that appear only at specific moments.

### How Videograph handles overlays

- Overlays can be persistent or time‑based.
- They are driven by templates or rules applied during processing.

## Best practices

- Provide subtitles for accessibility and compliance wherever possible.
- Use high‑contrast, legible text in overlays.
- Keep overlays lightweight to avoid obscuring critical content.
- Maintain a consistent style across thumbnails for strong brand recognition.
