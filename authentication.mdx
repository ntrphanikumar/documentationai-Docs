## Authentication Methods

Videograph (Docs) supports multiple authentication methods to ensure secure access to your documentation. Choose the method that best fits your organization's security requirements and user management preferences.

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Single Sign-On" icon="shield" href="#sso">
    Integrate with your identity provider for seamless authentication.
  </Card>
  <Card title="API Keys" icon="key" href="#api-keys">
    Generate and manage API keys for programmatic access.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Setting Up SSO

Single Sign-On (SSO) allows your team members to access Videograph (Docs) using their existing corporate credentials. This reduces password fatigue and simplifies user management.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose Provider" icon="settings">
    Select your identity provider from supported options including Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace, and SAML 2.0.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Settings" icon="sliders">
    Enter your provider's configuration details such as entity ID, SSO URL, and certificate.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Connection" icon="check-circle">
    Verify the integration works correctly by testing the login flow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable for Users" icon="users">
    Assign the SSO authentication method to your workspace users.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="info">
  Note: SSO setup requires administrative privileges and may take up to 24 hours for full propagation.

## API Key Management

API keys provide secure programmatic access to Videograph (Docs) resources. Use API keys for integrations, automation scripts, and third-party applications.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Generating Keys" icon="plus">
    To generate a new API key, navigate to Settings > API Keys and click "Create New Key". Choose appropriate permissions and set an expiration date if needed.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Managing Keys" icon="settings">
    View all active API keys, revoke compromised keys, and monitor usage statistics. Each key shows creation date, last used timestamp, and associated permissions.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Best Practices" icon="shield">
    Rotate keys regularly, use environment variables for storage, and monitor for unusual activity. Never commit API keys to version control systems.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
  ```javascript
// Authenticate with API key
const headers = {
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.VIDEOGRAPH_API_KEY}`,
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
};

fetch('/api/documents', { headers })
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
  ```
  ```python
import os
import requests

api_key = os.getenv('VIDEOGRAPH_API_KEY')
headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.get('/api/documents', headers=headers)
print(response.json())
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="What permissions can I assign to API keys?" default-open="false">
    API keys support granular permissions including read-only access, document creation, editing rights, workspace management, and administrative controls. You can create custom permission sets or use predefined roles like Viewer, Editor, and Admin.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="How do I revoke an API key?" default-open="false">
    Go to Settings > API Keys, find the key you want to revoke, and click the "Revoke" button. Revoked keys become invalid immediately and cannot be restored. You'll need to generate a new key and update any integrations.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Can I use both SSO and API keys?" default-open="false">
    Yes, you can use SSO for user authentication while still using API keys for programmatic access. API keys are separate from user accounts and maintain their own permission sets.
  </Expandable>
</ExpandableGroup>

<Callout kind="danger">
  Security warning: Never share API keys publicly or store them in insecure locations. Use environment variables and rotate keys regularly to maintain security.
</Callout>

## User Roles and Permissions

Videograph (Docs) uses a role-based access control system to manage user permissions within workspaces and documents.

| Role | Description | Permissions |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Viewer | Read-only access | View documents, search content |
| Editor | Standard editing | View, edit, create documents |
| Admin | Full control | All editor permissions plus user management, settings |
| Owner | Ultimate control | All admin permissions plus billing, workspace deletion |

<Callout kind="tip">
  Assign the minimum required permissions for each user to follow the principle of least privilege.
