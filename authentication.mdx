## How authentication works

All Videograph APIs are secured. Every request must include a valid API access token and secret key created from your organization environment in the dashboard. Each token pair is strictly scoped to that environment.

<Callout kind="info" collapsed="false">
  A token generated in one organization environment cannot access resources in another.
</Callout>

API access tokens define what environment your request operates in, ensuring isolation across development, staging, and production environments.

## Generating API credentials

Use this procedure whenever you need a new token and secret for backend or server‑side integrations.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your organization environment dashboard" title-type="p">
    Navigate to the environment where the API token will be used. All tokens are tied to this specific environment.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a new API access token" title-type="p">
    Find the API credentials section and generate a new token and secret key. Copy both values immediately; the secret is shown only once.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Store credentials securely" title-type="p">
    Save the token and secret in a secure system such as environment variables or a secrets manager.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip" collapsed="false">
  Rotate tokens periodically and delete credentials you no longer use.
</Callout>

## Using tokens with the API

All Videograph endpoints accept basic authentication using your token and secret key.

### Basic auth example (curl)

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.videograph.ai/video/services/api/v1/contents \
  -u "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN:YOUR_SECRET_KEY" \
  --header "content-type: application/json" \
  --data '{"title":"Sample upload"}'
```

### Basic auth example (SDK-style request)

<CodeGroup show-lines="true" tabs={[]}>
  ```javascript
  import fetch from "node-fetch";

  const token = process.env.VG_TOKEN;
  const secret = process.env.VG_SECRET;

  const creds = Buffer.from(`${token}:${secret}`).toString("base64");

  const res = await fetch(
    "https://api.videograph.ai/video/services/api/v1/contents",
    {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Authorization": `Basic ${creds}`,
        "content-type": "application/json"
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ title: "My video" })
    }
  );

  console.log(await res.json());
  ```

  ```python
  import os
  import base64
  import requests

  token = os.getenv("VG_TOKEN")
  secret = os.getenv("VG_SECRET")

  creds = base64.b64encode(f"{token}:{secret}".encode("utf-8")).decode("utf-8")

  headers = {
      "Authorization": f"Basic {creds}",
      "content-type": "application/json",
  }

  response = requests.get(
      "https://api.videograph.ai/video/services/api/v1/livestreams",
      headers=headers,
  )

  print(response.json())
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Environment scoping

Access tokens are limited to the organization environment where they were created. This ensures:

- A token cannot access data or APIs belonging to another environment.

- Each environment (such as development, staging, or production) is fully isolated.

- Token behavior is restricted to the environment’s configuration and permissions defined in the dashboard.

<Callout kind="info" collapsed="false">
  Tokens do not grant cross‑environment access. Always generate credentials inside the environment where the API integration operates.
</Callout>

## Security best practices

To protect your video workflows and ensure proper isolation:

- Store all tokens and secrets in a secure secrets manager or environment variables.

- Rotate credentials regularly.

- Revoke tokens immediately if you suspect exposure.

- Use separate organization environments for development, staging, and production.

<Callout kind="danger" collapsed="false">
  Never embed tokens or secrets in client‑side code, logs, or version control.
</Callout>
