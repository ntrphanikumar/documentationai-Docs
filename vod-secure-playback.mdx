## Overview

Secure playback ensures that only authorized viewers can access your Video on Demand content. Videograph supports several layers of protection, including token-based playback URLs, domain or referrer restrictions, and optional DRM integration for higher sensitivity use cases.

This page introduces the core threat model and the main controls you can use to harden playback flows.

## Threat model overview

When distributing VOD content, you may need to defend against:

- Link sharing: viewers redistributing a valid playback URL.
- Hotlinking: third-party sites embedding your player without permission.
- Unauthorized embeds in apps or platforms you do not control.
- Automated scraping or replay attacks against publicly exposed URLs.

Videograph's authorization controls help you prevent these issues when combined with your application's authentication logic and network policies.

## Tokenized playback URLs

Tokenized or signed playback URLs let you embed authorization constraints directly in the playback request. Use them to enforce rules such as:

- Expiration windows
- Allowed IP ranges
- Allowed domains
- Access scopes for specific assets or playlists

A typical flow is your backend issuing a short-lived playback URL or token for the asset your user is approved to watch.

  Never place signing secrets, private keys, or token generation logic in client-side code. Perform all signing on a secured backend and rotate secrets regularly.

### Example token payload

Below is a simplified pseudo-JSON example of the type of claims your backend might include when generating a signed URL or token:

```json
{
  "asset_id": "vid_123",
  "expires_at": 1714050000,
  "ip_allow": ["203.0.113.0/24"],
  "domain_allow": ["example.com"]
}
```

### Basic backend issuance pattern

1. Authenticate the viewer in your application.
2. Check authorization for the specific VOD asset.
3. Generate a signed playback URL or token with a short expiration time.
4. Embed the URL in your player or return it to your frontend for immediate playback.

## Domain and referrer restrictions

Domain or referrer checks let you limit playback to approved origins even when tokenized URLs leak. These restrictions help mitigate:

- Unauthorized iframe embeds
- Deep-linking from untrusted sites
- Player reuse on mirrored or cloned domains

You can combine domain restrictions with signed URLs to create multi-factor authorization: the request must present a valid token and originate from an approved domain.

## DRM and advanced controls

For higher-security use cases, Videograph can integrate with DRM systems. DRM ensures that only authorized devices with valid licenses can decrypt and view your content.

Common scenarios include:

- Premium subscription video
- Early-release content requiring device-level enforcement
- Environments needing hardware-backed key protection

While Videograph does not mandate a specific DRM provider, the general model involves license servers, encrypted content keys, and device-level enforcement. Pairing DRM with tokenized URLs and origin checks provides a layered defense.

## Best practices checklist

Use this quick checklist when designing a secure VOD playback system:

- Generate signed playback URLs or tokens on a secure backend only.
- Keep token lifetimes short and include restrictive claims such as domain and IP allowlists.
- Validate referrers or permitted domains whenever possible.
- Consider DRM for high-value or regulatory-sensitive content.
- Rotate secrets periodically and store them securely.
- Combine playback authorization with your application authentication system.
- Monitor logs and audit suspicious playback behavior.
