## Why metadata matters

Metadata helps you make video catalogs searchable, sortable, and maintainable at scale. Videograph supports structured fields such as title, description, duration, and thumbnails, along with flexible custom key-value pairs for business-specific data. Tags offer lightweight labeling for search, recommendations, and workflow grouping.

## Core metadata fields

Common fields you can set on an asset include:

- Title and short description
- Duration and thumbnails
- Season and episode identifiers
- Rating or content classification
- Custom key-value fields for editorial, rights, or workflow needs

These fields travel with the asset across the ingest, processing, and delivery pipeline.

## Tags and taxonomies

Tags allow fast, lightweight labeling so you can:

- Power faceted search in internal tools or apps
- Enable recommendation engines
- Drive workflows such as QC, editorial review, or rights checks

Tags can be flat or implemented as internal taxonomies you maintain. Use consistent naming patterns to keep catalogs clean.

  Consistency is key. Align naming, casing, and tag patterns across teams to ensure your catalog stays discoverable and predictable.

## Organizational patterns

Videograph assets can be grouped into several structures:

### Playlists

Use playlists to present ordered collections of assets, such as episodes, modules, or themed bundles. They are ideal when sequence or curation matters.

### Channels

Channels act as logical groupings that can mix live streams and VOD assets. They help organize content by brand, category, or theme.

### Workspaces

Workspaces often map to environments or business units. They isolate assets, channels, and playlists so teams can work independently while keeping governance clear.

## Example asset metadata

Below is a simplified example showing structured metadata and tags on a single asset.

```json
{
  "title": "Episode 3: The Journey",
  "description": "Exploring the next chapter of the story.",
  "duration": 1420,
  "season": 1,
  "episode": 3,
  "thumbnails": [
    "https://cdn.example.com/thumbs/ep3-small.jpg"
  ],
  "custom": {
    "rating": "PG-13",
    "rightsRegion": "US"
  },
  "tags": ["adventure", "featured", "season1"]
}
```
